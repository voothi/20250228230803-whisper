## Title
Always Restart in Default Language Mode

## Staging
Make it so that when you click the restart button on the tray icon, the application will always restart in mode without specifying a language. Now, if the application was launched with a language, that is, I selected, for example, the Russian item in the menu, then it will restart as Russian.

## Implementation Details
The application uses `sys.argv` to pass arguments to the restarted instance. When a language is selected via the tray menu, it restarts with `--language=[lang]`. A subsequent "generic" restart currently preserves this argument.

Modified the `restart()` function in `whisper.py` to filter out any `--language` flags from the command line arguments passed to the new process. This ensures the application returns to its default state (no specific language forced).

## Status
- [x] Implemented in v1.4.4
