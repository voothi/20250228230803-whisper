## Title
Fragment Transcription Mode

## Description
Make a launch key in which copying to the clipboard occurs as a line starting with a small letter and at the end of the sentence without a period.

## Status
Staging

## Context
Perhaps the utility whisper-faster.exe itself has such a mode, and if not, then we need to provide it in our logic. So that I can dictate individual words and I don’t have to, like now, change the capitalization of this word and remove the period at the end when inserting it into my Anki dictionary.

## Implementation Details
- **Config**: Added `hotkey_fragment` to `config.ini` (default `<ctrl>+<alt>+f`).
- **Logic**: 
  - Added `fragment_mode` state.
  - When triggered, transcription result is post-processed:
    - First character lowercased.
    - Trailing period removed.
- **Output**: Transcribed text is copied to clipboard with these transformations.
