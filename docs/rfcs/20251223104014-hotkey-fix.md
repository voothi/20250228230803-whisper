## Title
Layout-Independent Hotkeys

## Staging
Explain why it might have stopped intercepting the Ctrl-Alt-E and Ctrl-Alt-F key combinations after the latest improvements?

There have been improvements to Fragment Mode. But this mechanism could sometimes fail earlier, before yesterday’s improvements. This may be due to combinations being intercepted by other programs in the Windows 11 Pro environment, but this is not certain, since it sometimes works, sometimes it doesn’t in the same environment.

## Implementation Details
- **Issue**: `pynput` relies on character mapping, which varies by keyboard layout (e.g., 'E' vs 'у' on Russian layout).
- **Solution**: Refactored hotkey listener to use Virtual Key Codes (VK) for character keys while maintaining standard canonicalization for modifier keys.
- **Result**: Hotkeys `Ctrl+Alt+E` and `Ctrl+Alt+F` now work consistently across all keyboard layouts (English, Russian, etc.) as they target physical key positions.

## Status
- [x] Implemented in v1.4.14.
