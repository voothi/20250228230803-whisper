# One-Word Mode

**ZID**: 20251228170757

## Description
Added a "One-Word Mode" to the system tray menu. This mode changes the transcription behavior to produce word-by-word subtitles instead of sentence-based splitting, which is useful for creating detailed subtitles or for specific integration needs where exact word timing is crucial.

## Implementation Details

### Changes
1.  **Global State**: Added `one_mode` and `default_one_mode` flags to track the setting.
2.  **CLI Arguments**: Added `--one-mode` argument to `whisper.py` to allow the setting to persist across application restarts (e.g., language switching).
3.  **Command Execution**:
    -   When enabled, the wrapper passes `--one_word 2` to the `fast-whisper.exe` executable.
    -   When enabled, the default `--sentence` argument is omitted.
4.  **Tray Interface**: Added a toggleable "One-Word Mode" item to the system tray context menu.
5.  **Interaction**:
    -   Enabling "One-Word Mode" works independently of "Fragment Mode".
    -   Ideally, these modes are mutually exclusive in practice, but the code handles them by prioritizing flags or allowing them to coexist if the underlying engine permits (though logic currently swaps argument sets). *Correction*: In the final implementation, activating Fragment Mode via tray automatically disables One-Word Mode to prevent conflict, as they use different CLI splitting strategies.

### Analytics & Decisions
-   **Why `--one_word 2`?**: This specific argument provided by the underlying `fast-whisper.exe` tool triggers the word-level segmentation logic.
-   **Persistence**: It was critical to ensure this setting survives a "Restart" (used for language processing) so the user doesn't lose their configuration context.
