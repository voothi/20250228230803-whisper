Check that all RFC files in @rfcs follow the same template. They have already been implemented.
Think about whether you need to link to them from @[release-notes.md] .

## Implementation Details
- Standardized the format of existing RFC files in `docs/rfcs/` to follow a consistent structure: Title, Staging, Implementation Details, Status.
- Updated `release-notes.md` to include direct links to the relevant RFC documents for recent versions.

## Status
- [x] Implemented in v1.4.8
